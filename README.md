Wow, just walked out of Deva my brain is still spinning like a whirlpool. You know when you have to like squint your eyes coming out of darkness into light? And the popcorn machine was louder than my thoughts, like it was yelling pop pop pop into my ear. I think I spilled half a tub on my lap and now there's butter grease like a crime scene on my jeans, need like, forensic cleaners or something.

So Deva, was... I mean, what's the word when your brain feels full but also like soup? Yeah, kinda like that. There was this one scene, the one with the glowing blue fish swimming through the air, like someone turned a Picasso painting into a daydream. My back's aching like a grandma's, those seats should be illegal. But ughhh, the way it ended?? Like if a cat had been directing, chasing its own tail around the plot. 

> Remember how we talked about 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 the   and craning over our tiny laptop screens? Not this one. You HAVE to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   in a theater, it’s like… you're inside a kaleidoscope that just swallowed infinity. 

There was this other scene, the one in the rain — no wait, the one where it was raining inside a room but only in the corners. The guy next to me kept coughing, like he'd swallowed a frog and it was trying to croak its way out, pretty sure he wasn't a part of it! My head kinda swam with all those strange loud whispers, like threads trying to stitch invisible stories together. My phone buzzed but I couldn't take my eyes off that woman weaving through the crowd like a dancer lost in her own music.

Quite bewildering, honestly. Like trying to catch smoke with a fishing net. There's a rat-tat-tat of heels in there somewhere that I can't shake loose. Back outside and it’s muted gray skies and people moving like they're stuck in molasses. Don’t know how long I sat there, bench's hard as regret. 

𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  ? Wait till the chaos comes in 4𝘒, but maybe it's better bathing in surround sound. I think my brain cells took a hike halfway through. Catch it soon, before it slides outta theaters and into our lives like a passing cloud.
